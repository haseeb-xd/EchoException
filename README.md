## What's This About?

Your `NullPointerException` just became a main character moment.

Echo Exception is an IntelliJ plugin that announces your exceptions like a fighting game character entering the arena. When your code crashes, **Satoru Gojo** might casually remind you about that null pointer, or **Sage** from Valorant will precisely call out your array bounds violation. 

It's debugging, but make it cinematic.

---

<!-- Plugin description -->
Echo Exception transforms mundane stack traces into memorable moments. Instead of silently reading error messages, hear them announced by iconic characters with custom voice packs. Visual notifications pop up in sync with the audio, making exception handling feel less like a chore and more like an event.

Currently featuring voice packs from Satoru Gojo (Jujutsu Kaisen) and Sage (Valorant), with more characters coming soon. Perfect for developers who want personality in their debugging workflow, live coders, streamers, or anyone who's tired of silent exceptions.

**Key Features:**
- Audible exception announcements with character voices
- Animated toast notifications that appear on exception detection
- Multiple voice packs: Gojo's chaotic confidence and Sage's precise callouts
- Fully configurable settings for volume, notifications, and voice selection

## Features

### Character Voice Packs

**Satoru Gojo** (Jujutsu Kaisen)

More characters incoming. Suggest your favorites in the [issues](https://github.com/haseeb-xd/EchoException/issues).
